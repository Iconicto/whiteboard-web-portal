### How it works?

#### Questionnaire
An initial questionnaire is made by the lecturer at the beginning of the week.

#### Personalised Content
According to the response received by the student, the study materials and video tutorials get personalised to educate the student in an effective manner.

#### Quizzes
At the end of each week a quiz will be given by extracting personalised questions retrieved from the question bank based on the responses he gave in the questionnaire.

#### Statistics
There will be a statics option where the student is allowed to self access their performance for the week.
